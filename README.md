## Project Explanation:

#### Part A. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting using Seasonal Arima Model. 

##### Data Discover:
1. Loading Dataset
* **Dataset 1: National Grid Dataset** 
    - Features used: 
        - **TimeStamp:**  Date from 1/06/2011 to 24/09/2020 (includes daily data with 5 mins of equal interval of time).
        - **Demand:** Sum of Demand recorded by Central Montioring Meters for 5 mins of interval. Actual demand is may higher as those met by embeded technology like small wind turbines and domestic solar panels. (solar power not included)

* **Dataset 2: Library Holiday**
    - Feature used:
        - Date: Date from 1/06/2011 to 24/09/2020 
        - uk_holidays: Consist True boolean value for UK public holiday date.

**2. Data Cleaning:**
- Check Null values
    - Zero null values present in dataset.
- Check duplicate values
    - Found 59 duplicate rows (Added/Repeat because of daylight saving time change).

**3. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis**
**a. Daily Electricity Demand**

**Analysis:** Found consistent downtrend with constant decrease in magnitude also have seasonal trend too.

**b. Yearly Electricity Demand Trend & Regression Analysis**

<img src="Images/YearlyRegression.png" height="400"/>
<img src="Images/YearlyTrend.png" height="400"/>

#### Analysis: 
- Trend: 
    - Intially i.e before 2012 till 2014 the electiricity demand trend is constant or higher as compared to current electricity demand.
        - After 2014 observed constant decrease in electricity demand.
        - Reason: Because Uk govt. start promoting other energy sources like domestic & commercial solar panels, smart devices at home and industries, etc.
        - Article (https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/30/uk-electricity-use-falling-economy-weather) appreciate UK govt and residents as they consume comparitively less electircity than other European countries.
- Regression Line:
    - Regression line shows best fit hence indicate constant downtrend in electricity demand.

**c. Monthly Electricity Demand Trend**

<img src="Images/MonthlyTrend.png" height="400">
<img src="Images/MonthlyRegression.png" height="400">

#### Analysis:
- Trend: 
    - Monthly demand helps to identify clear seasonal pattern.
    - As this observation help while decomposing the time series.
    - Data is seasonal with approximately decrease in magnitude demand.
- Regression Line:
    - Shows best fit hence indicate constant downtrend in electricity demand with constant decrease in magnitude.

**d. Daily Trend & Identify steep decrease electricity demand in 2018 & 2019**
<img src="Images/DailyTrend2018.png" height="400">
<img src="Images/DailyTrend2019.png" height="400">

#### Analysis:
- There is an seasonal pattern during the year.
    - **In 2019:**
        - There is an steep decrease on 8th December, 2019.
        - Because there was an storm ATIYA, hence in many areas of uk face power cut for hours.
        - Refrence: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/09/uk-weather-britain-battered-by-high-winds-as-storm-atiya-sweeps-in
    - **In 2018:**
        - No news available why electircity demand less on that day.

**e. Weekly Electricity Demand Trend**

<img src="Images/WeeklyTrend.png" height="400">
<img src="Images/WeeklyRegression.png" height="400">

#### Analysis:
- Trend: 
    - Weekly demand visualization shows clear seasonal pattern as well as downtrend.
    - Data is seasonal with approximately decrease in magnitude demand.
- Regression Line:
    - Shows best fit hence indicate constant downtrend in electricity demand with constant decrease in magnitude.

**f. Holiday Impact on Electiricity Demand**

<img src="Images/HolidayImpact2018.png" height="400">
<img src="Images/HolidayImpact2019.png" height="400">

#### Explanation:
- Try to analyse for 2018 and 2019 data
    - In 2018 & 2019:
        - As assumed, during holidays electricity demand has been decreased.
        - It's natural as many offices and manufacturing plants shutoff.
        - Hence electricity demand is less.


### DEVELOP:

#### 1. Data preprocessing -  Outlier Handling**
<img src="Images/OutlierCurve.png" height="400">

#### Explanation:
- Suspect outliers at both end of box plot.
    - Records Below Lower Quartile:
        - By for records below lower quartile has been imputed/handled by analysing 2 weeks data.
        - Impute with most common/mode value for that outlier.
    - Records Above Upper Quartile:
        - By for records above Upper Quartile has been imputed/handled by analysing 1 Month data.
        - One intresting thing i encounter that, those outlier occured in one month i.e Feb- 2012.
        - Found article: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/case-studies/snow-feb-2012.
        - Stats that during month of feb 2012 there is an historic snowfall observed in UK.
        - Also for the whole month electricity demand is consistent.
        - Hence to adjust or handle this outlier we impute the mean/avg demand in whole month.

#### 2. Statistical Test
- To check data is normally distributed or not using - Shapiro-Wilk Test.

#### 3. TIME SERIES FORECASTING MODEL
Followed below steps:

#### Step 1. Time Series Decomposition plot
- Allow to identify Seasonality-Trend-Error/Remainder.

<img src="Images/Decomposition.png" height="400">


#### Step 2. Determine ARIMA terms
- Check data is stationary or not:
    - Performed Dicky-Fuller statistical test - found data is not stationary.
- To make it stationary:
    - Took 2 time differencing to make data stationary.

#### Stationary Data

<img src="Images/diff2stationary.png" height="400">

#### Step 3a. Term Identification & Train SARIMA Model
- As our data is seasonal so we have to determine seasonal as well as non seasonal parameters - Inshort, ARIMA (p,d,q) (P,D,Q)m

#### Identify Baseline Model parameters**
- To get baseline parameters impute different set of patterns and identify low best AIC value 
- Results as below: 
<img src="Images/BaslineResult.png" height="400">

#### Manually or with help of statistical analysis:
- Autocorelation & Partial Autocorelation

<img src="Images/AutoCorrelation.png" height="400">
<img src="Images/PartialAutoCorrelation.png" height="400">

#### Explanation:
- The above plots helps us to identify we have to select AR-K lags or MA
- ACF plot:
    - As it have exponential decrease or lags1 have correlation with previous lag0.
    - Hence, we select AR-K lags model
    - What will be the value of AR (p) and MA (q)
    - As exponential decrease is happen till lag 1.
    - Hence, p, P = 1 and q,Q=0 or 1 (As we are selecting AR model)
    - Final SARIMA parameters:
    - p, P = 1
    - d, D = 1 # Because we take 2 time seasonal differencing to make data stationary
    - q, Q = 0/1
    - m = 12 (as we are considering Monthly seasonal data)
    
  
#### Train SARIMA Model
- Trained with below mention parameters and its AIC result: 
- SARIMA(1, 2, 1)x(1, 2, 1, 12) - AIC:376.4879793804362
- SARIMA(1, 2, 0)x(1, 2, 0, 12) - AIC:416.47908203652696
    - As here when we consider both AR and MA in model we get slightly more good AIC value.
    - Also, the AIC is good than basline model.
    - Hence, final model is SARIMA(1, 2, 1)x(1, 2, 1, 12) - AIC:376.4879793804362
    
#### Final Model Summary

#### Diagonostic plot

#### Step 3b. Validation SARIMA Model
1. First try to predict results for lower end of train data found below prediction.

<img src="Images/trainprediction.png" height="400">

#### Explanation:
    - The line plot is showing the observed/Train values compared to the forecast predictions.
    - Overall, our forecasts align with the true values very well:
    - Showing an downtrend trend starts from the beginning of the year 2018 and
    - After mid of year again as per seasonality move upward in the same direction.
    - Hence our model is forecasing good results

### 2. Calculate Metrics / Results

#### MSE:
- The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of our forecasts is 191.98
    - The mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the errors i.e., the AVG Squared difference between the estimated values and forecasted/estimated. 
    - The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimatorâ€”it is always non-negative, and the smaller the MSE, the closer we are to finding the line of best fit.

#### RMSE:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) tells us that our model was able to forecast the average daily Electricity Demand in the Train set within 13.86 of the real demand. 
- The daily electricity demand range from around 203 to over 374 GW. 
- Overall this is a pretty good model so far.

## Step 4. Forecasting and Validate with Test data
- Validate Test Data

- Validate Test Data along with Future 12 month prediction

## Conclusion
- Our model clearly captured Electricity demand tend & seasonality.
- As we forecast further out into the future, it follows the original Downtrend as well as seasonality pattern.
